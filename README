ScalaTion

Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based Simulation System. 

This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling 
including 'dynamics', 'activity', 'event', 'process' and 'state' oriented 
models. Scala is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.

In addition to the packages focused on simulation, there are several support
packages: 'util', 'math', 'random', 'stat', 'scala2d', 'plot', 'animation' 
and 'optimization'.

Future directions include adding 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

Requires: Scala 2.10 and Java 1.6

      scalation.zip
	  
  2. Unzip or untar the file:
      > tar xvfz scalation.tar.gz
      > unzip scalation.zip
	  
  3. Start SBT:

     The generated documentation is in target/scala-2.10/api

  5. Run examples (e.g., for process oriented):
      Still in SBT console
      > run-main event.Bank
