ScalaTion

Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based Simulation System. 

This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling 
including 'dynamics', 'activity', 'event', 'process' and 'state' oriented 
models. Scala is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.

In addition to the packages focused on simulation, there are several support
packages: 'util', 'math', 'random', 'stat', 'scala2d', 'plot', 'animation' 
and 'optimization'.

Future directions include adding 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

Requires: Scala 2.8 and Java 1.6

Installation Instructions

  1. Download one of the following two file:
      scalation.tar.gz
      scalation.zip
	  
  2. Unzip or untar the file:
      > tar xvfz scalation.tar.gz
      > unzip scalation.zip
	  
  3. If necessary re-build the scalation system (it's pre-built):
      > cd scalation
      > scalac Build.scala
      > scala Build

  4. Run examples (e.g., for process oriented):
      > cd examples/process
      > scalac -cp ../../classes -d classes Bank.scala
      > scala -cp ../../classes:classes Bank
