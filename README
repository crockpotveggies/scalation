ScalaTion is a system coded in Scala that supports multi-paradigm simulation 
modeling including dynamics, activity, event, process and state oriented models.
Scala is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language that is 
well-suited for developing simulation engines.

In addition, there are support packages for scala2D, advmath, stat and animation
as well as a small util package.

Requires: Scala 2.8 and Java 1.6
